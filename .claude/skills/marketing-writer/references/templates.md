# Marketing Content Templates

All templates follow the brand voice principles: casual, direct, no buzzwords, focus on real benefits, simple language.

## Landing Page Feature Section

Use the **Problem → Solution → Benefit** format.

### Template

```markdown
## [Feature Name in Plain English]

[Problem statement - what annoys the user?]

[Solution - what does this feature do? Keep it simple.]

[Benefit - what's the specific outcome? Use numbers if possible.]

[Optional: Quick example or use case]
```

### Example 1: CSV Upload Feature

```markdown
## Upload Your Data in Seconds

Tired of copying and pasting between spreadsheets? Spent Friday 
afternoon formatting data for the hundredth time?

Upload your CSV and we'll handle the rest. Drag, drop, done.

Get your analysis in 30 seconds instead of 30 minutes. That's 
14 hours back every month.
```

### Example 2: Auto-Save Feature

```markdown
## Never Lose Your Work Again

We've all been there. You spend an hour on something perfect, 
then your browser crashes. Everything's gone.

Your work saves automatically every few seconds. No save button. 
No thinking about it.

Write with confidence knowing your work is safe. Even if your 
laptop dies mid-sentence.
```

### Example 3: Team Sharing Feature

```markdown
## Share Work Without the Back-and-Forth

Stop emailing files back and forth. Stop with the 
"Final_v2_ACTUALLY_FINAL.docx" naming. Stop asking "did you 
see my changes?"

Click share, paste the link, they see your work. All updates 
happen in real-time.

Spend your time actually working instead of managing versions 
and chasing people down.
```

### Structure Tips

- **Problem**: 1-2 sentences, make it relatable
- **Solution**: 1-2 sentences, explain what the feature does
- **Benefit**: 1-2 sentences, specific outcome with numbers if possible
- **Example**: Optional, shows real usage
- **Length**: Keep total under 100 words

### What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't lead with features:**
"Our advanced cloud-based collaboration platform features real-time 
synchronization capabilities..."

✅ **Lead with the problem:**
"Stop emailing files back and forth..."

❌ **Don't use vague benefits:**
"Boost productivity and efficiency"

✅ **Use specific outcomes:**
"Save 2 hours every week on status updates"

---

## Tweet Thread Template

Structure: **Hook → Credibility → Value → CTA**

### Template

```
1/ [Hook - surprising fact, bold claim, or relatable pain point]

2/ [Credibility - why you built this, your experience with the problem]

3/ [The problem in detail - make them feel it]

4/ [Your solution - what you built and why it's different]

5/ [How it works - simple explanation, no jargon]

6/ [Specific benefit - with numbers or concrete outcomes]

7/ [Social proof or early results - if available]

8/ [CTA - what to do next, make it easy]
```

### Example 1: Launching a Time Tracking Tool

```
1/ I spent 2 hours last Friday trying to remember what I worked on 
all week. Never again.

2/ As a freelancer, I've tried 12 different time tracking apps. 
They all suck. Too complicated, too many clicks, or they don't 
actually help me invoice clients.

3/ Here's the problem: Time tracking should take 5 seconds, not 5 
minutes. If it's annoying, you won't do it. And if you don't do it, 
you can't invoice accurately.

4/ So I built TimeSnap. One click to start tracking. One click to 
stop. That's it. No categories, no tags, no configuration.

5/ How it works: Click start when you begin work. Click stop when 
you're done. End of week, you get a clean list of what you did and 
for how long. Export to invoice.

6/ It takes literally 2 seconds to track time now. I used to spend 
30 minutes a week reconstructing my time logs. That's 26 hours a 
year I'm getting back.

7/ Been using it for a month. Haven't missed a single billable hour. 
My invoices are accurate and my clients actually get them on time now.

8/ It's free to try. No credit card needed. If you're tired of 
complex time tracking, give it a shot: [link]
```

### Example 2: New Feature Announcement

```
1/ We just shipped a feature that saves our users 2 hours every 
single morning. Here's how:

2/ For context: I've watched dozens of people spend their entire 
morning copying data from emails into spreadsheets. It's mind-numbing 
work.

3/ The problem isn't that the work is hard—it's that it's repetitive. 
Same data, same spreadsheet, every single day. But it has to be done.

4/ So we added email imports. Forward your daily report emails to a 
special address, and we automatically pull out the data and update 
your spreadsheet.

5/ Here's how it works: Set up once (takes 2 minutes). Then just 
forward your emails. We extract the numbers, update your sheet, and 
send you a notification when it's done.

6/ Real impact: Sarah used to spend 90 minutes every morning on data 
entry. Now she forwards 3 emails and it's done in 30 seconds. She 
starts her actual work at 9am instead of 10:30am.

7/ We've processed 1,200 emails in the first week. That's roughly 
200 hours of manual work saved across our users.

8/ Already a user? Check your dashboard—it's live now. Not a user 
yet? Try it free: [link]

### Structure Tips

- **Tweet 1 (Hook)**: Grab attention immediately
- **Tweet 2 (Credibility)**: Establish why you understand the problem
- **Tweet 3 (Problem)**: Make the pain relatable
- **Tweet 4 (Solution)**: Introduce what you built
- **Tweet 5 (How it works)**: Simple explanation
- **Tweet 6 (Benefit)**: Specific, measurable outcome
- **Tweet 7 (Proof)**: Optional, but powerful if you have data
- **Tweet 8 (CTA)**: Clear next step

### Thread Tips

- Keep each tweet under 280 characters
- Each tweet should make sense on its own (people skim)
- Use line breaks for readability
- No hashtags unless absolutely necessary
- End with a clear call-to-action
- Link in the final tweet, not scattered throughout

### What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't use buzzwords:**
"Revolutionary AI-powered solution that leverages machine learning..."

✅ **Be specific:**
"Uses pattern recognition to auto-fill your forms"

❌ **Don't oversell:**
"This will change your life forever!!!"

✅ **Be realistic:**
"Saves about 2 hours a week on data entry"

## Launch Email Template

Structure: **Personal intro → Value prop → Easy CTA**

### Template

```
Subject: [New Feature Name] is live

Hey [Name/everyone],

[Personal intro - why you built this, what problem you noticed]

[What you built - simple explanation in 1-2 sentences]

[Why it matters - specific benefit to the reader]

[How to use it - very brief, 1-3 steps max]

[Optional: What's next - if you're looking for feedback]

[Easy CTA - one clear action]

[Sign off]
```

### Example 1: New Feature to Existing Users

```
Subject: Auto-save is here (finally)

Hey everyone,

I've read way too many support tickets that start with "I lost all 
my work when..." So we finally built auto-save.

Your work now saves automatically every 5 seconds. No save button. 
No keyboard shortcuts to remember. It just works.

This means you can close your browser, your laptop can die, or your 
cat can walk across your keyboard—and you won't lose anything.

It's already live in your account. You don't need to do anything 
to enable it. Just keep working like normal.

Let me know if you notice any issues. We tested it thoroughly, but 
we're watching closely during the first week.

Try it out and let me know what you think.

Thanks,
[Name]

P.S. Yes, it works with the offline mode too. We've got you covered.
```

### Example 2: Launch Email for New Product

```
Subject: I built something for you

Hey there,

For the past 6 months, I've been working on something that fixes a 
problem I've had forever: creating invoices shouldn't take 30 minutes.

I built InvoiceSnap. You answer 3 questions, we generate a 
professional invoice. Download it as a PDF or send it directly to 
your client. Takes about 90 seconds start to finish.

Why this matters: You can now send an invoice right after finishing 
a project instead of putting it off for days because "making invoices 
is annoying." Get paid faster, do less admin work.

To try it:
1. Go to invoicesnap.com
2. Click "Create Invoice"
3. Fill in your info (we save it for next time)

It's free for your first 10 invoices. No credit card required. If 
you like it, plans start at $5/month.

I'd love to know what you think. Reply to this email with any 
feedback—I read every single one.

Thanks,
[Name]
```

### Example 3: Major Update Announcement

```
Subject: We rebuilt the dashboard from scratch

Hey everyone,

We heard you. The old dashboard was confusing. Too many clicks to 
find what you needed. We rebuilt it.

The new dashboard shows you exactly what matters: your active 
projects, recent activity, and what needs your attention. 

Everything you used to need 3-4 clicks to find is now right there 
when you log in. No digging through menus.

It's live now in your account. Log in and you'll see it. Everything 
you had before is still there—we just organized it better.

If something feels off or you can't find what you're looking for, 
hit reply and let me know. We'll fix it.

Thanks for sticking with us while we made this better.

[Name]

P.S. If you liked the old layout for some reason, there's a "classic 
view" toggle in settings. But try the new one first.
```

### Email Tips

- **Subject line**: Clear, specific, not clever (save cleverness for tweets)
- **Opening**: Personal, explains why you built this
- **Value prop**: Specific benefit, not features
- **How to use**: Maximum 3 steps, or just say "it's automatic"
- **CTA**: One clear action, make it easy
- **Length**: Under 200 words total
- **Tone**: Like you're emailing a friend

### What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't use corporate language:**
"We're excited to announce a new solution that empowers users..."

✅ **Write like a human:**
"We built something I think you'll like..."

❌ **Don't list features:**
"Features include: real-time sync, cloud storage, mobile apps..."

✅ **Explain the benefit:**
"Your work is available everywhere. Phone, laptop, tablet—same stuff."

❌ **Don't oversell:**
"This game-changing feature will revolutionize your workflow!!!"

✅ **Be honest:**
"This should save you about 10 minutes a day on reports."

## Product Description Template

For directories, app stores, or "About" pages.

### Template

```
[One-liner - what it does in under 10 words]

[Who it's for - specific, not "everyone"]

[What it does - 2-3 sentences max]

[Why use it - specific benefits, not generic claims]

[Optional: How it's different - if there's a unique angle]
```

### Example 1: Task Management App

```
A to-do list that actually helps you finish things.

For people who've tried every productivity app and still end up with 
a list of 100 half-done tasks.

Add your tasks, set deadlines, and we'll bug you at the right time. 
Not too early (annoying), not too late (useless). Just when you 
need the reminder.

Stop maintaining your to-do list and start finishing it. Most people 
complete 3x more tasks in their first week.

No complex projects, no time tracking, no team features. Just you 
and your list.
```

### Example 2: Screenshot Tool

```
Screenshots without the hassle.

For anyone who takes screenshots and then spends 5 minutes cropping, 
annotating, and sharing them.

Click, drag, done. We automatically crop to what you selected, let 
you add arrows and text in 2 seconds, and copy it to your clipboard.

Instead of opening your screenshot in an editor, cropping it, adding 
annotations, saving it, and then uploading it somewhere, you do one 
click. That's it.

Built for people who take 20+ screenshots a day and are tired of 
the 16 extra steps.
```

### Example 3: Invoice Generator

```
Create invoices in 90 seconds.

For freelancers and small business owners who find invoicing more 
annoying than the work itself.

Answer 3 questions, we generate a professional PDF. Send it directly 
to your client or download it. Works on your phone.

Stop putting off invoices because "making them is tedious." Create 
and send invoices right after you finish the work, get paid faster.

No monthly fees for features you don't need. Pay per invoice, only 
when you actually send one.
```

### Description Tips

- **One-liner**: Should be clear even to someone who's never heard of it
- **Target user**: Be specific - "everyone" is no one
- **What it does**: Plain language, no jargon
- **Benefits**: Concrete outcomes, not buzzwords
- **Length**: 50-100 words total

## Update Announcement Template

For when you ship improvements or fixes.

### Template

```
## [Update Name/Date]

[What changed - specific, not vague]

[Why we changed it - the problem it solves]

[What it means for you - concrete benefit]

[Optional: What's next - if relevant]
```

### Example 1: Performance Improvement

```
## We made the dashboard 3x faster

Loading time went from 6 seconds to 2 seconds. Clicking between 
sections is instant now.

We heard from a bunch of you that the old version felt sluggish. 
You were right. We rewrote how we load data.

This means less waiting around. You can jump between projects, check 
stats, and get back to work without staring at loading spinners.

We're working on mobile app performance next—same issue, should be 
fixed in two weeks.
```

### Example 2: UI Improvement

```
## New sidebar makes everything easier to find

We moved your most-used features to a sidebar that's always visible. 
Projects, files, and settings are now one click away instead of three.

People kept telling us "I can never find where to..." and we realized 
our navigation was buried in menus.

You'll spend less time hunting for stuff and more time actually using 
it. Everything you used multiple times a day is now right there.
```

### Example 3: Bug Fix

```
## Fixed the upload bug

Files over 10MB now upload correctly. Previously they'd fail halfway 
through and you'd have to start over.

We messed up the upload handling in last week's release. Our bad.

You can now upload your big files without crossing your fingers. It 
just works, like it should've from the beginning.
```

## Quick Reference: Voice Guidelines

**Do:**
- Use contractions (it's, you're, we'll)
- Write short sentences
- Address reader as "you"
- Use numbers when possible
- Show specific examples
- Say what it actually does
- Explain the outcome

**Don't:**
- Use buzzwords
- Make vague claims
- Use corporate speak
- Rely on superlatives
- Use jargon unnecessarily
- Hype without substance
- Over-explain

**Test your copy:**
- Would you say this to a friend?
- Is every word necessary?
- Are you showing or just telling?
- Is the benefit concrete?
- Can a 12-year-old understand it?

If you answer "no" to any of these, rewrite.
